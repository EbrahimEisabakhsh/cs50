project :  Electronic Institude 
Video Demo :


Dear ;
This is Ebrahim Eisabakhsh from Dubai-UAE and it's about my final project. 
I created a webpage to introduce my institute and company online.
Our company is electronic and electric repair to fix all kinds of
electronic devices especially computers ,laptops, mobiles and others...

At the bottom of the project main page, I design Service, pickup/
Delivery at customers office or home to solve their problem ,repair or
install and fix even at their doorstep in UAE  by sending us location.

At the menu bar of the home page we have "About Us", "Contact Us" and some 
Photos and videos as "Gallery". I provide a "Learn" navigation bar to 
introduce our educational classes. Our institute provides three levels of 
classes which are Basic, Intermediate and Advanced electronics. 

Here I will explain some of the main items of courses in the "Learn" menu.
In these three menus I explain some of the syllables of our classes in six 
weeks or in 45 days. In the third term we teach students to be able to  solve 
normal primary problems and start repairing and fixing computers, printers 
and mobile phones ...

I used WordPress and Elementor in Cpanel to write the same webpage in my mother 
language two years ago. But now I am happy to write and create the same pages 
by myself through lines of codes by myself.

thank you
